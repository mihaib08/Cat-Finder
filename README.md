# Cat Finder

_Matlab_ application which *predicts* if there is a cat in a given picture or not with an average accuracy of **80%**, being based on the picture's _histogram_.

Developed by using _Numerical Methods_ algorithms, which aim to solve a _linear_ system `Ax = b` for generating a _vector_ **w** describing the images model:
- _Householder_
- _Gradient Descent_, which starts from a _random_ approximation of **w**, and then successively finds more appropiate values for **w**
